# PTNArtifacts

This project contains code artifacts that I've found re-usable during my professional experience as an iOS-developer. It contains following libraries:

* PTNLogger - logger library 
* PTNAdditions - useful categories library
* PTNControls - useful custom GUI controls library
* PTNStorage - convenient interface for storing user defaults and app parameters
* PTNArtifacts - library which combines all above libraries
